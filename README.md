# SVM_Java_Example

A multiclass Support Vector Machine built with Java.

This program generates three linearly separable dataset, although custom dataset can be used as along as it is linearly saparable.
The training dataset can be graphical displayed on the scatter graph (make sure the neccessary libraries are imported correctly).
The hyperplane and the weights can easily be calculated with the help of the program.
